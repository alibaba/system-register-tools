Coding style
============

0. Generally, we use linux kernel coding style, see:

   https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst

Additionally, please refer to the following tips before coding:

1. Use only one word or abbreviation for naming a directory and all letters must
   be lowercase, e.g. "documentation", "doc", "mydir", "etc", and so on

2. No more than 3 words for naming a file and only one underscore "_" is allowed
   between them, and all letters must be lowercase, e.g. "my_file.c"

3. The golden rule for naming functions, structures, variables, files,
   directories or whatever things is to use as few words as possible, i.e. never
   use 2 words if 1 word is possible and never use 3 words since 2 words are
   possible

4. Do not confuse the reader/reviewer for naming things like functions,
   variables, and so forth

5. Only use single-character options e.g. "mytool -x" and never use
   multi-character options e.g. "mytool â€”xxxxxx" for command line of your
   tools/utilities, and if you find a must to add more options to your tool,
   that means you may have to split your tool like "mytool command -x", but it
   is free to use whatever style for scripts

6. All binary outputs, e.g. utilities, libraries, kernel modules should be named
   with no more than 3 words and only a dash "-" is allowed between them and all
   letters must be lowercase, e.g. "rox-util"

7. Only add comments in "English" and actually other languages should never
   exist in your source files

8. Only use format "#ifndef __XXXXXX_H__" in header files

9. User space functions should return -1 or NULL for error and set errno when
    necessary

10. Never add unnecessary comments and pass on clear semantics in only codes

11. To check and fix complains, run: check_coding_style.sh
